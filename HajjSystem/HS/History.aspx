                    <p>Pilgrims from J&K proceeding for Haj through Sea Route during British Rule through  and earlier, starting their holy journey from the Sea-Port of Bombay. The records available indicate the existence of the Haj Committee, Bombay in the year 1927. The then Commissioner of Police Mr. D. Healy, Esq., was the President of Haj Committee, Bombay and prominent Muslim Public Representatives were the Members. The first formal meeting of Haj Committee, Bombay was held on 14th April, 1927</p>
                    <p>On 1st October, 1932, the Port Haj Committees Act of 1932 was passed, to establish Committees in the principal Ports of Pilgrim Traffic, to assist the Muslim Pilgrims to Hedjaz. It envisaged the constitution of Port Haj Committee, Calcutta and Port Haj Committee, Bombay. </p>
                    <p> The Port Haj Committee of Bombay continued to work under the President ship of Commissioner of Police, Bombay till April, 1939. On 4th April, 1939 Mrs. Khadija Shuffi Tyabji was elected President of the Port Haj Committee, Bombay.</p>
                    <p>The Port Haj Committee, Bombay rendered necessary services to the Pilgrims proceeding for Haj till 1959. On 17th December, 1959, the Haj Committee Act of 1959 (No.51 of 1959), was passed, to establish a Committee in the Port of Bombay for assisting Muslim Pilgrims to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran & Jordan and for matters connected therewith. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Mustafa Fakih was elected the first Chairman of Haj Committee constituted under the Haj Committee Act 1959.</p>
                        <p>As a global phenomenon the passenger travel by ships declined. People started travelling by air. Air travel was introduced gradually for Haj Pilgrims also. Till the year 1994 around 5,000 Pilgrims used to travel by Ship from the Sea Port of Bombay for performing Haj and about 19,000 Pilgrims used to travel by Air. However, from the year 1995 travelling of Haj Pilgrims by Sea-Route was fully discarded and all the Pilgrims travelled for Haj through Air.</p>
                        <p>After introduction of air travel, it was no more necessary for all the Haj Pilgrims to reach Bombay. Gradually other Embarkation Points were introduced. The number of Embarkation Points went on increasing year after year. The details of the Embarkation Points are as under:-</p>

                    <p>With the introduction of more & more Embarkation Points, the management of Haj also diversified. It was felt necessary to have appropriate representation from all parts of the country in the Haj Committee of India. Accordingly, Haj Committee Act 2002 (No.35 of 2002) has been passed. It envisages representation in the Haj Committee of India from all parts of the country. </p>
